# Tasks

Task 1: Add pet and age column to the database and allow users to update these fields on their profile. DONE

Task 2: Implement token flow as we have done so far for /register end point as well. DONE

Task 3: Add Sign out functionality where you revoke the token when a user signs out of the app DONE

Task 4 (Bonus): You may notice a lot of repeated code (especially when it comes to fetch()). How can you improve this? Try to refactor the code and perhaps also improve the logic to make the app even better!
